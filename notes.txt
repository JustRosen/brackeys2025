i think there should only be 2 power ups u get per duel


add power ups

rotate - rotate the chamber forward once
reveal - reveal a random unknown slot
skip - skips your turn
gamble - Gain another turn if u shoot yourself

maybe an extra life\

instead of scaling up rects, instead divide the mpos by the render_Scale or not the render scale but the   mpos divided by (window size / display size)

done: player outline kinda
Fixed enemy outline and positioning

do a shot death animation and self death animation
add power up code
